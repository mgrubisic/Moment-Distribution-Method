Hardy Cross developed the moment distribution method for analyzing beams and frames, which he formally presented in 1930. Unlike the slope-deflection method, this approach is approximate and eliminates the need to solve simultaneous equations. The accuracy of the results obtained using moment distribution depends on the number of successive approximations or iterations performed. It specifically considers flexural effects while neglecting axial and shear effects. Before widespread computer usage in structural design and analysis, the moment distribution method was the most widely employed.

The moment distribution method is an iterative approach that overcomes the challenges posed by structures with numerous degrees of indeterminacy or freedom. By employing moment distribution, engineers can manually analyze highly indeterminate structures with many degrees of freedom.

Named after its inventor, engineering professor Hardy Cross, the method was published in a concise ten-page paper in September 1932. This publication, titled "Analysis of Continuous Frames by Distributing Fixed-End Moments," revolutionized the field of structural engineering by enabling precise structural analysis.

The moment distribution method is an exact technique that relies on a series of successive and improved approximations to calculate the bending moments in beams and frames.

### This algorithm in Matlab, for the iterative solution of the Moment Distribution Method, is used at the University of Osijek, at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture Osijek, at the Department of Technical Mechanics under the Structural Analysis 2 course.
